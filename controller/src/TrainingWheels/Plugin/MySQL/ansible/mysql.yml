    # This step is critical if we want to run the playbook again. Because of the way Ansible
    # runs sudo (without the -i parameter), the mysql_user module will look for .my.cnf in
    # the home directory of the user from which we are sudoing, which could be anything.
    # We thus need to store the .my.cnf credentials in the user and root's home folders.
