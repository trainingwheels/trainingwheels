# Variables for use in the ec2 rebuild script. Make a copy of this if you want to use it, and modify as required.

# The server type / name
SERVER='build'

# The branch that is cloned
BRANCH='master'

# The EC2 tag used.
TAG_VAL='trainingwheels-autobuild'

# The elastic IP address.
IP_ADDRESS='0.0.0.0'

# If this is being run from a server within EC2, say a control box,
# it's faster to use the internal IP address, so the default setting is to assume
# internal and leave it up to the rebuild script to calculate the hostname
# However, for testing, it may be necessary to run from outside of EC2
# so you can override by passing the hostname.
EC2_EXTERNAL='internal'
